## Opening (1 min)

**"Good morning Abby, Hana. Thank you for walking us through your KAMs' workflow and pain points. We've built Tribble Platform to fundamentally solve these challenges‚Äînot with a tool, but with a Connected Intelligence System."**

### Key Pain Points Tribble Solves
1. ‚úÖ Call prep takes 45+ minutes ‚Üí **Tribble autonomously queries all systems in seconds**
2. ‚úÖ No AI summary of past visits/data ‚Üí **Tribble understands your Exceedra history conversationally**
3. ‚úÖ Missing next best action suggestions ‚Üí **Tribble cross-references similar stores with proof**
4. ‚úÖ Can't easily see what worked in similar stores ‚Üí **Tribble finds patterns across your entire network**
5. ‚úÖ Hard to link actions to sales impact ‚Üí **Tribble writes back to systems and tracks outcomes**

**"This isn't generic AI. This is Tribble Platform‚Äîyour autonomous intelligence layer. Let me show you..."**

## Scenario Setup (30 sec)

**"Sarah Williams is a KAM covering Greater Manchester. It's Monday morning at 9:15am, and she has 3 store visits today."**

**Show iPhone screen**

**"This is Sarah's morning. She wakes up, opens her phone, and Tribble has already prepared her day."**

**"Traditionally, Sarah would spend 45 minutes PER STORE:"**
- Manually reviewing Exceedra visit notes
- Pulling SAP sales reports
- Checking Power BI dashboards
- Googling competitor promotions
- Correlating everything mentally

**"That's over 2 hours of prep before her first visit. With Tribble Platform, she opens her phone and everything's ready."**

```

**"Critical issues are surfaced automatically. Sarah can address them proactively before the manager brings them up."**

### üéØ **Highlight #5: Talking Points**

**"The system even tailors the opening based on the store manager's preferences..."**

```markdown
Talking Points
Tailored for David Thompson (Data-driven, responsive to category performance)

1. "Your Immunity category is growing 12% vs 8% territory average"
   - Type: data-driven | Context: Opening statement to engage data-focused manager

2. "I wanted to recognize Adult Nutrition outperforming territory by 2%"
   - Type: recognition | Context: Build rapport by acknowledging success
```

**"Sarah knows David loves data, so she leads with numbers. This is relationship intelligence."**

### Step 4: Mobile One-Pager (30 sec)

**"For the actual visit, Sarah has this on her phone..."**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/kam/prep/JOBID/artifact/onepager
```

**"Everything she needs at a glance while standing in the store."**

---

## Close with Impact: The Full Loop (2 min)

**"So what Sarah used to do in 45 minutes of manual work, Tribble Platform does autonomously in 20 seconds."**

**"But here's where Tribble Platform becomes truly transformational..."**

### Conversational Refinement (30 sec demo)

**"After reviewing the brief, Sarah has a follow-up question..."**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/kam/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "storeId": "UK12345",
    "kamEmail": "sarah.williams@nestle.com",
    "message": "Manager David Thompson hates long documents. Can you give me a visual one-pager instead?",
    "conversationId": "session-abc123"
  }' | jq
```

**Tribble responds:**
```
"I've regenerated the brief as a mobile-optimized one-pager with:
‚Ä¢ Top 3 priority actions (visual icons)
‚Ä¢ Key stats dashboard (immunity +12%, ¬£16,916)
‚Ä¢ Critical alert (Boost Plus OOS)
‚Ä¢ Opening line for David
Ready to view at /artifact/onepager"
```

**"Notice: Tribble REMEMBERED the store context, the brief content, and David's preferences. This is conversational intelligence."**

### Write-Back & Impact Tracking (30 sec explanation)

**"After the visit, Sarah simply tells Tribble what happened..."**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/kam/post-visit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "storeId": "UK12345",
    "actions": ["Secured manager approval for Immunity+ display", "Resolved Boost Plus OOS"],
    "commitments": ["Q4 campaign participation"]
  }'
```

**"Tribble Platform automatically:"**
- ‚úÖ Writes structured visit note to Exceedra API
- ‚úÖ Updates Salesforce opportunity stage ‚Üí "Committed"
- ‚úÖ Creates calendar reminder for 2-week follow-up
- ‚úÖ Notifies regional manager via Slack
- ‚úÖ **Schedules workflow**: In 2 weeks, pull SAP data, check for immunity lift

**"Two weeks later, Tribble autonomously shows Sarah:"**
```
‚úÖ Your Immunity+ display at UK12345 ‚Üí +9% category lift
‚úÖ OOS resolution recovered ¬£630 in sales
‚úÖ Replicate this playbook? 3 similar stores identified.
```

**"Now Sarah KNOWS what works. She can replicate success across her 20-store territory with confidence."**

## What Makes This Different (30 sec)

**"This isn't just AI. This isn't just faster data access. This is Tribble Platform‚Äîa Connected Intelligence System that:"**

1. **Autonomously queries** your enterprise systems (Exceedra, SAP, Power BI, SharePoint)
2. **Understands multimodal content** (campaign decks, images, playbooks)
3. **Generates visual intelligence** (charts, dashboards, slides)
4. **Maintains conversational context** (refine briefs in dialogue)
5. **Writes back to systems** (closed-loop intelligence)
6. **Works proactively** (scheduled workflows, impact tracking)

**"Generic AI APIs give you text generation. Tribble Platform gives you autonomous intelligence."**

**"That's what we wanted to show you today."**

## Q&A Anticipated (1 min buffer)

### **Q: "How does this integrate with our existing systems?"**
**A:** "Tribble Platform connects directly to your systems via their APIs‚ÄîExceedra REST API, SAP data warehouse connectors, Power BI REST API, SharePoint/Google Drive indexes. The Tribble Agent autonomously queries these on-demand. No ETL pipelines, no data warehousing required. We can also integrate the conversational interface into your existing mobile app, web portal, Slack, or Teams."

### **Q: "What about data privacy and security?"**
**A:** "All data stays within your Tribble Platform instance. We can deploy in your VPC, on-premise, or your preferred cloud environment. The Tribble Agent never shares store data externally‚Äîit queries your systems, synthesizes insights, and returns intelligence directly to your KAMs. We're SOC 2 compliant and support GDPR requirements."

### **Q: "Can we customize the recommendations and intelligence?"**
**A:** "Absolutely. Tribble Platform is configurable at every level. You can adjust similarity scoring thresholds, add custom action templates, set territory-specific rules, define what 'success' looks like, and even train the agent on your specific playbooks and campaign materials. The more you feed it, the smarter it gets."

### **Q: "How accurate are the similar store matches?"**
**A:** "Tribble uses multi-factor similarity across region, format, demographics, footfall, manager preferences, and historical performance patterns. You saw 87% match for Liverpool-Central. We typically surface 3-5 matches above 80% similarity. The matching algorithm is tunable, and KAMs can provide feedback to refine future matches."

### **Q: "What if there's no historical data for a new store?"**
**A:** "Great question. For new stores, Tribble Platform falls back to region-wide patterns, retailer-specific benchmarks, and demographic proxies. It explicitly flags 'limited historical data' in the brief and adjusts confidence scores accordingly. As visit data accumulates, the intelligence improves automatically."

### **Q: "How long to deploy this for our team?"**
**A:** "We can have a pilot running for 5-10 KAMs within 2-3 weeks. Week 1: Connect Tribble to your systems (Exceedra, SAP, Power BI, SharePoint). Week 2: Pilot with your KAMs, gather feedback. Week 3: Refine and scale. The Tribble SDK accelerates this significantly‚Äîno custom development needed."

### **Q: "This looks complex. How much development effort is required?"**
**A:** "That's the beauty of Tribble Platform. Generic AI would require 4-6 months of custom development‚ÄîETL pipelines, data warehouses, custom integrations. With Tribble, it's 2-3 weeks because the platform DOES the work. The Tribble Agent autonomously queries systems, understands content, generates visuals, writes back. You're not building infrastructure‚Äîyou're connecting to a complete intelligence system."

### **Q: "What about multimodal capabilities‚Äîcan it really understand our campaign decks?"**
**A:** "Yes. Tribble Platform has native multimodal understanding. Upload your Q4 Immunity campaign deck (PowerPoint, PDF, images), and Tribble can reference specific slides, extract visual insights, and recommend which slides to show for a specific store. For example: 'Show slide 7 with the growth chart‚Äîit resonates with this store's data-driven manager.' That's not possible with generic text-only AI."

---

## Post-Demo Follow-Up

**"We'd love to set up a pilot with a small group of KAMs to prove Tribble Platform's value in your environment. Here's what that looks like:**

### **3-Week Pilot Plan**

**Week 1: Platform Setup**
- Connect Tribble Platform to your systems (Exceedra API, SAP, Power BI, SharePoint)
- Upload campaign materials, playbooks, enablement content
- Configure workflows (morning briefings, post-visit tracking)
- Deploy conversational interface (Slack/Teams/mobile)

**Week 2: Pilot with 5-10 KAMs**
- KAMs use Tribble alongside existing workflow
- Daily feedback collection
- Track time savings, usage patterns, intelligence quality

**Week 3: Refine & Scale**
- Adjust based on KAM feedback (tone, format, data sources)
- Add custom playbooks and territory rules
- Expand to 20-30 KAMs
- Measure impact: time saved, action success rates, sales lift correlation

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 40+ minutes saved per visit (45min ‚Üí 2-5min)
- Higher quality calls (data-backed recommendations)
- Proven action-to-impact tracking
- KAM confidence in what works

**"Would a pilot like this be valuable for Nestl√© Health Science?"**

## Success Metrics

**You've crushed it if they say:**
- ‚úÖ "This would save our KAMs so much time"
- ‚úÖ "The autonomous system queries are exactly what we need"
- ‚úÖ "I love that it writes back to Exceedra automatically"
- ‚úÖ "The conversational refinement is powerful"
- ‚úÖ "Can we pilot this with our team?"
- ‚úÖ "How quickly can we get this running?"

**Red flags to watch for & how to respond:**

**‚ùå "We already have tools that do this"**
‚Üí **Response:** "What you have are tools that ACCESS data. Tribble Platform is a connected intelligence LAYER that autonomously SYNTHESIZES across all those tools. Your current tools can't query Exceedra + SAP + Power BI simultaneously, find similar stores with 87% match, and generate proof-backed recommendations in 20 seconds. That's the difference between data access and autonomous intelligence."

**‚ùå "This seems complicated"**
‚Üí **Response:** "That's the beauty‚Äîit's complex underneath but simple for Sarah. She asks one question. Tribble does everything else. Show the mobile one-pager: 'This is what Sarah sees in-store. Top 3 actions, key stats, opening line. That's it.'"

**‚ùå "How much does it cost?"**
‚Üí **Response:** "Let's focus on the pilot first. If we can save your 100 KAMs 40 minutes per visit, that's 70 hours per day across the team‚Äîequivalent to 9 full-time KAM positions of productivity unlocked. That's the ROI baseline. Let's prove the value with 5-10 KAMs first, then we'll discuss commercial terms based on measured impact."

**‚ùå "Can't we just use ChatGPT or generic AI?"**
‚Üí **Response:** "Generic AI gives you text generation. You'd still need to build ETL pipelines, data warehouses, integrate with Exceedra/SAP/Power BI, create visual generation, implement write-back, and build scheduled workflows. That's 4-6 months of custom development and ¬£300-500k. Tribble Platform IS that entire stack‚Äîpre-built, ready to connect. We deploy in 2-3 weeks, not months."

**Good luck! You've got this. üöÄ**
