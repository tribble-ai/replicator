## 💡 Demo Talking Points (While Showing on Phone)

### Opening
**"This is what Sarah sees on her iPhone every morning at 7am."**

### Show Home Screen
**"Tribble already prepared her first visit. She woke up to intelligence, not work."**

### Tap First Brief
**"Look at this executive summary - in 3 seconds of reading, Sarah knows everything:
- Store performing 'Excellent'
- Immunity up 12%
- Critical OOS alert on Boost Plus
- Top recommendation with proof"**

### Scroll to Actions
**"Here's the game-changer: Tribble found Birmingham Fort - a 91% similar store - that did this vitamin display reposition and got +15% lift, 312 units, £2,890 revenue.

Sarah walks in with PROOF. The manager can't say 'I don't think that'll work'—Birmingham already proved it."**

### Show Metrics
**"Visual, scannable, color-coded. Green = good news. Red = urgent.

This isn't a PDF. This isn't a web form. This is iOS-quality UX built for Sarah's workflow."**

### Generate Second Brief
**"Watch this - tap Boots Liverpool."**

[Tap it]

**"Tribble is NOW querying Exceedra, SAP, Power BI autonomously. 2 seconds."**

[Wait for it to load]

**"Done. Fresh intelligence. Sarah didn't lift a finger."**

### Close
**"This is how we transform 45 minutes of prep into 2 minutes of review.

And this is just visit prep. Imagine:
- Post-visit tracking (Tribble writes to Exceedra automatically)
- Impact measurement (Tribble checks SAP 2 weeks later, reports lift)
- Success replication (Tribble finds what works, spreads it)

That's Tribble Platform."**

**Check:**
1. Are both devices on the same WiFi network?
2. Is your firewall blocking port 3000?
3. Try this command to allow connections:
   ```bash
   # On Mac, allow port 3000
   sudo pfctl -d  # Disable firewall temporarily for testing
   ```

### "Page loads but looks broken"

**Try:**
1. Hard refresh on phone (pull down to refresh)
2. Clear Safari/Chrome cache
3. Check console for errors:
   - Safari: Settings > Advanced > Web Inspector
   - Chrome: chrome://inspect

### "Install to Home Screen not showing"

**For iPhone:**
- Must use Safari (not Chrome)
- Make sure you're on the page, then tap Share button

**For Android:**
- Must use Chrome
- May need to wait a few seconds for install prompt
