- 7am daily: "Here's your prep for today's 3 visits"
- Triggered workflows: post-visit summaries, weekly territory reviews

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### **Use Case 1: Autonomous Pre-Call Prep**

**Traditional Approach (45 minutes):**
1. KAM opens Exceedra, reviews last 3 visits (10 min)
2. Pulls SAP report, analyzes sales trends (15 min)
3. Checks Power BI dashboard, compares to territory (10 min)
4. Googles competitor promotions manually (5 min)
5. Looks for similar store playbooks in SharePoint (5 min)

**With Tribble Platform (2 minutes):**
```
KAM: "Prep me for Tesco Manchester Arndale tomorrow at 10am"

Tribble Agent autonomously:
├─ Queries Exceedra API → Last 3 visits summarized
├─ Pulls SAP sales data → 90-day trends + category analysis
├─ Searches Power BI → Performance vs territory benchmark
├─ Web research → Boots/Superdrug promotions this week
├─ SharePoint search → Similar store success playbooks
├─ High Spot query → Latest immunity campaign materials
└─ Generates visual brief with:
   • Visit history summary with follow-up actions
   • Sales performance dashboard (charts)
   • 4 prioritized next best actions with proof points
   • Competitor activity alerts
   • 3-slide PowerPoint for store manager meeting
   • Mobile one-pager for in-store reference
```

**Result:** Intelligence delivered, not data dumped.

---

### **Use Case 2: Conversational Refinement**

```
KAM: "Prep me for UK12345"
Tribble: [Generates comprehensive brief with PowerPoint deck]

KAM: "Actually, manager David Thompson is very visual but hates decks.
      Can you give me an infographic instead?"
Tribble: [Remembers context, regenerates as one-page infographic]

KAM: "What if he pushes back on the immunity display due to shelf space?"
Tribble: [Pulls objection handling from playbooks]
         "3 similar stores faced this. Solution: floor display instead.
         Liverpool store saw +9% lift with floor placement.
         I've attached the visual mockup from the campaign deck."

KAM: "Perfect. Log that I'm planning to propose floor display as backup."
Tribble: [Updates visit plan in Exceedra]
```

**Result:** KAM has a **strategic conversation**, not a static report.

---

### **Use Case 3: Multimodal Campaign Leverage**

**Scenario:** New Q4 Immunity campaign launches with 20-slide deck, product images, display mockups.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Campaign deck sits in SharePoint
- KAMs read it once, forget details
- No connection to store-specific recommendations

**With Tribble Platform:**
```
[Upload campaign deck to Tribble]

KAM: "Based on the Q4 Immunity deck, what should I emphasize
      for Tesco UK12345?"

Tribble:
"Your store UK12345 has high footfall + ABC1 demographics.
• Slide 7: Winter wellness growth chart (+23% YoY) - lead with this data
• Slide 12: Premium display mockup - matches your store format
• Slide 15: Competitor gap analysis - Boots has 30% more immunity space
• Product image on slide 8: Use the Immunity+ lifestyle shot—resonates
  with your store's customer base

I've created a 3-slide extract tailored to UK12345.
Shall I email it to the store manager as a pre-meeting primer?"
```

**Result:** Campaign materials are **actively leveraged**, not passively stored.

---

### **Use Case 4: Cross-System Pattern Recognition**

```
KAM: "Why is my immunity category underperforming vs territory?"

Tribble Agent cross-references:
├─ Exceedra: Visit frequency + action types
├─ SAP: Sales trends + SKU mix
├─ High Spot: Enablement completion rates
├─ SharePoint: Campaign asset usage
└─ Finds pattern:

"Insight: Stores where you've implemented the end-cap display (logged in
Exceedra) show +14% immunity lift. But you've only done this in 3 of 12 stores.

Top performers in your territory have:
• End-cap display (campaign deck slide 12)
• Staff trained on immunity benefits (enablement module 3)
• Educational leaflets at checkout (asset library)

Your stores WITHOUT all three: +2% average
Your stores WITH all three: +18% average

Recommendation: Prioritize stores UK12346, UK12349, UK12351 next.
They have high footfall + untapped immunity potential."
```

**Result:** Tribble finds **causal insights**, not correlations.

---

### **Use Case 5: Automated Post-Visit Close-Loop**

```
[KAM completes store visit]

KAM (via mobile): "Visit done at UK12345. Secured 2 facings for Immunity+,
                   resolved Boost Plus OOS, manager committed to Q4 campaign."

Tribble autonomously:
├─ Writes structured visit note to Exceedra
│  • Action: Secured 2 facings (Immunity+ range)
│  • Issue resolved: Boost Plus Vanilla OOS
│  • Commitment: Q4 campaign participation
│
├─ Updates Salesforce
│  • Opportunity stage: "Committed"
│  • Next action: Follow-up in 2 weeks
│
├─ Creates calendar reminder
│  • "Check immunity display execution @ UK12345"
│  • Scheduled: Oct 24, 2025
│
├─ Notifies regional manager (Slack)
│  • "UK12345 committed to Q4 campaign (3rd store this week!)"
│
└─ Triggers scheduled workflow
   • In 2 weeks: "Pull SAP data for UK12345 immunity lift"
   • Auto-generate impact report if lift detected
```

**Result:** **Closed loop**—intelligence leads to action, action updates systems automatically.

---

### **Use Case 6: Proactive Morning Briefings (Scheduled Workflows)**

**Setup once:**
```javascript
// Define workflow on Tribble platform
tribble.workflows.create({
  name: "morning-kam-briefings",
  schedule: "0 7 * * 1-5", // 7am weekdays
  prompt: `For each KAM with visits scheduled today:
  1. Pull today's calendar
  2. For each store visit:
     - Generate pre-call brief (visit history, sales, actions)
     - Create mobile one-pager
     - Include "ask me anything" conversational link
  3. Deliver via Slack DM by 7:15am`
});
```

**Every morning:**
- KAMs wake up to Slack message: "Good morning! 3 visits today. Here are your briefs:"
  - [Tesco Manchester - Brief + One-Pager]
  - [Boots Liverpool - Brief + One-Pager]
  - [Superdrug Leeds - Brief + One-Pager]
  - Button: "💬 Talk to me about any visit"

**Result:** **Proactive intelligence**—prep done before KAMs log in.

## Problems Solved (Abby's Email, Revisited)

### **Pain Point 1: Call prep takes 45+ minutes**
**Solution:** KAM asks one question. Tribble autonomously pulls from all systems. 2 minutes total.

### **Pain Point 2: No AI summary of past visits**
**Solution:** Tribble queries Exceedra directly, summarizes with context from other systems.

### **Pain Point 3: Missing next best action suggestions**
**Solution:** Tribble cross-references similar stores, pulls playbooks, generates proof-backed recommendations.

### **Pain Point 4: Can't see what worked in similar stores**
**Solution:** Tribble searches Exceedra for similar store profiles + actions, correlates with SAP sales lift.

### **Pain Point 5: No action-to-impact tracking**
**Solution:** Tribble logs actions, monitors SAP post-visit, auto-generates impact reports: "Your display rec → +9% lift."
